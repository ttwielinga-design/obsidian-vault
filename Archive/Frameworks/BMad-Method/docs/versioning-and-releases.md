# How to Release a New Version

## Automated Releases (Recommended)

The easiest way to release new versions is through **automatic semantic releases**. Just commit with the right message format and push and everything else happens automatically.

### Commit Message Format

Use these prefixes to control what type of release happens:

```bash
fix: resolve CLI argument parsing bug      # → patch release (4.1.0 → 4.1.1)
feat: add new agent orchestration mode     # → minor release (4.1.0 → 4.2.0)
feat!: redesign CLI interface              # → major release (4.1.0 → 5.0.0)
```

### What Happens Automatically

When you push commits with `fix:` or `feat:`, GitHub Actions will:

1. ✅ Analyze your commit messages
2. ✅ Bump version in `package.json`
3. ✅ Generate changelog
4. ✅ Create git tag
5. ✅ **Publish to NPM automatically**
6. ✅ Create GitHub release with notes

### Your Simple Workflow

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add team collaboration mode"
git push

# That's it! Release happens automatically 🎉
# Users can now run: npx bmad-method (and get the new version)
```

### Commits That DON'T Trigger Releases

These commit types won't create releases (use them for maintenance):

```bash
chore: update dependencies     # No release
docs: fix typo in readme      # No release
style: format code            # No release
test: add unit tests          # No release
```

### Test Your Setup

```bash
npm run release:test    # Safe to run locally - tests the config
```

## Manual Release Methods (Exceptions Only)

⚠️ Only use these methods if you need to bypass the automatic system

### Quick Manual Version Bump

```bash
npm run version:patch   # 4.1.0 → 4.1.1 (bug fixes)
npm run version:minor   # 4.1.0 → 4.2.0 (new features)
npm run version:major   # 4.1.0 → 5.0.0 (breaking changes)

# Then manually publish:
npm publish
git push && git push --tags
```

### Manual GitHub Actions Trigger

You can also trigger releases manually through GitHub Actions workflow dispatch if needed.
